# IN1910 Programming with Scientific Applications â€“ Coursework

Taken in the fall of 2019. This course had 3 projects throughout the semester, each one part of the course evaluation. We were tasked to work in groups of 2, therefore none of these projects are solely my own work. For each project we attempted to fairly divide tasks by complexity and interest, discussing implementation then taking turns doing the programming, then troubleshooting together where neccessary.

Each project folder contains its own README file which describes the project.

## Exam Presentations

Rather than an exam this course had an oral evaluation at the end of the semester. For this evaluation we were asked to prepare a presentation for each of the 3 projects. One of the projects was then randomly selected for us to present to the examiners, before a few questions about the curriculum as a whole were asked. These presentations were done individually.

All 3 presentations are included in their own folder.
