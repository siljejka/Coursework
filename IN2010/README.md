# IN2010 Algorithms and Datastructures â€“ Coursework

This folder contains 3 subfolders, one for each of the 3 mandatory assignments given for the course IN2010 in the fall of 2020. The folders contain the original assigment text, the code for the assignment, and the assignment report covering some theoretical foundations of the course as well as a brief analysis of the implemenetation results where relevant for the assignment.

## Formatting
The reports were written in markdown then converted to pdf using Pandoc. Both the markdown and pdf files are included for archiving purposes, but contains the exact same information.
